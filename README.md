# Support Chess Bot with Deep Learning
- using [Chess Game Dataset (Lichess)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/chess) [20000 games]
- install requirements.txt or for gpu usage install `tensorflow-gpu` ([how to use](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51306862/how-do-i-use-tensorflow-gpu))
- I found [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-a-chess-engine-with-deep-learning-b9477ff3ee3d) post pretty helpful.
